        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>8 slices cooked ham</li>
            <li>4 slices Swiss cheese, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup cornflakes cereal crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Make the chicken rolls: Place each chicken breast half between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to about 1/8 inch thickness.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Place a piece of cheese on each ham slice and sprinkle lightly with thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Roll up seasoned ham and cheese jellyroll-style, then roll each chicken breast with ham and cheese inside. Tuck in ends and fasten with toothpicks.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Place melted butter in a small bowl and place cereal crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl. Dip each chicken roll in butter, then roll in crumbs, turning to coat thoroughly. Place coated rolls in the prepared baking dish.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the cordon bleu sauce: Mix together condensed soup, sour cream, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until combined.</p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Serve sauce hot over chicken rolls. Enjoy!</p>
